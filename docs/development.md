# Development

This guide covers development setup and contributing to otava-test-data.

## Development Setup

Clone the repository and install development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/otava-test-data.git
cd otava-test-data
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Running Tests

Run the test suite with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=otava_test_data --cov-report=html
```

## Code Style

This project uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

## Building Documentation

Build the Sphinx documentation:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Or using invoke:

```bash
invoke docs
```

## Releasing

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. The workflow publishes to PyPI when a release is created.

### Release Process

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Commit the version change
3. Create and push a git tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
4. Create a GitHub Release from the tag
5. The GitHub Action will automatically build and publish to PyPI

### PyPI Trusted Publishing Setup

The publish workflow uses PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC). To enable this:

1. Go to your PyPI project settings
2. Add a new trusted publisher with:
   - Owner: your GitHub username or organization
   - Repository: otava-test-data
   - Workflow name: publish.yml
   - Environment: pypi

For TestPyPI, create a similar trusted publisher with environment: testpypi

### Manual Testing with TestPyPI

You can manually trigger the workflow to publish to TestPyPI for testing:

1. Go to Actions > Publish to PyPI
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. This will build and publish to TestPyPI only

Install from TestPyPI to verify:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ otava-test-data
```
